export const CODEXHOST_DELEGATION_SKILL = `---
name: codexhost-delegation
version: ${SKILL_VERSION}
description: >
  Delegate tasks to other coding agents, or read and follow up on existing
  external agent sessions. Use when the user asks another agent (including
  @agent) to independently perform a task, or asks to view a specified external
  session's content, progress, or results, send follow-up messages, wait, or
  cancel a task. Not for recapping the current conversation, discussing or
  configuring agents, or role-playing.
---

# Execute the task

The \`CODEXHOST_CLI_PATH\` environment variable holds the absolute path of the CLI
for this Host. Always invoke the CLI through that path. Do not run a bare
\`codexhost\`: it is absent from \`PATH\` in some installations and may resolve to a
different Host's CLI. If the variable is not set, report that delegation is
unavailable from this session instead of searching \`PATH\`.

Before acting, run the help command, using the syntax of the shell you execute
commands in:

- POSIX shells: \`"$CODEXHOST_CLI_PATH" delegate --help\`
- PowerShell: \`& $env:CODEXHOST_CLI_PATH delegate --help\`
- cmd: \`"%CODEXHOST_CLI_PATH%" delegate --help\`

Use CLI help as the authoritative source for commands and behavior. Consult
command-specific help for options and the Harness listing command when the
target is unknown. Prefer compact output when supported, and use its task links
directly for subsequent commands.

Use the Harness native defaults. Inspect the target when a Model or Thinking
selection is needed or the default is unavailable.

Before starting a task, read \`delegate start --help\` from the same CLI. Use
\`--execution-policy\` only when that help advertises it; a new Skill or source
checkout does not upgrade an older installed CLI or connected Host. Do not
install or replace a runtime merely to make a documented option available.

When supported, \`--execution-policy default|unattended-full-access\` selects
persisted execution intent. Omission and explicit \`unattended-full-access\` are
equivalent, including request identity. Explicit \`default\` requests native
behavior without added unattended elevation; it is not a read-only sandbox or
revocation of saved native authorization. Official Codex currently rejects
explicit \`default\`. Preserve the requested policy across retries; never switch
policy or request ID to replay an UNKNOWN task.

For Cursor, reasoning and speed are native Model parameters. Inspect the target
and use the exact returned opaque Model ref matching all requested parameters.
For example, \`cursor-grok-4.6-xhigh\` requests Grok 4.6 Extra High with Fast Off;
that native CLI alias is not the Host ref, and \`--thinking xhigh\` is not the
Cursor selector. Never silently substitute High or Fast. If the directory is
missing the requested combination, report it as unavailable. If current native
parameters are unknown, do not infer a default from directory defaults.

Cursor unattended intent maps to native \`--force\`; native restrictions and
questions still apply. A discoverable Model, accepted start request, or passing
fixture does not prove successful native execution. Read the actual task result
and report native catalog/configuration failures without repeatedly resubmitting
the task or claiming execution success.

For a new delegation, create an independent child session and submit the
requested task. For an existing external session, resolve the target from the
user-provided session link, identifier, or context and operate on that Thread
directly; it need not have been created by the current assistant. If the target
is ambiguous, ask the user to identify it. Keep requests to view or summarize a
session read-only.

For a new or existing task, choose the appropriate next action based on the
user’s request and the task:

- send a follow-up message to the same Thread;
- cancel its current Turn;
- read its current state immediately;
- wait for a bounded period;
- check it again later;
- leave it running in the background.

When the result is needed, explicitly read the target Thread. Report only the
visible result returned by that Thread, together with the target agent, status,
and a labeled task link. Keep internal tracking IDs in tool calls.

Provide the user with the necessary tracking information available from the
CLI; omit unavailable fields rather than inventing them:

- target agent;
- \`delegationId\`;
- \`threadId\`;
- \`turnId\`;
- \`deepLink\`;
- current or final status.

Reuse \`--request-id\` for the same parent, Harness, cwd, task, and configuration.
A conflicting parent, cwd, task, or configuration with that ID must be rejected;
do not invent a new request-id to retry an UNKNOWN or cancelled task.

Use compact \`thread status\` for an immediate check and \`thread wait-many\`
for one bounded batch wait. When only actionable changes are needed, prefer
\`thread observe\`: it renews wait-many internally, tracks revisions, suppresses
ordinary progress, and returns once on completion/failure, pending input, changed
Turn, resync/error, a review deadline, or total timeout. It does not call a Model.
Set per-target \`reviewAt\` deadlines and one bounded overall timeout from the
current help. Consume \`result.targets\` to resume; remove handled terminal targets
and advance handled deadlines. Read only changed Threads and request tool/file
proof through \`thread evidence\`; hashes and self-reports are not execution proof.

The outer shell/tool must itself support sustained waiting. Keep one observer
process and its process handle when the tool yields; do not start duplicate
observers. If programmatic tool orchestration is available, await all process-handle
polls inside one tool invocation and allow that invocation to outlast the
observer timeout. Repeated outer tool polling can still cause Model calls. Never claim
zero coordinator wakeups from the observer process alone or promise it can wake
a suspended parent. Missing \`pendingInteractions\` is reported as
\`inputVisibilityUnavailable\`, not assumed to mean no input is needed. Observer
SIGINT/SIGTERM stops observation only; it does not cancel or release child work.

Cancel only acknowledges the cancel request and Turn terminal. It is not job
quiescence. Do not release a worktree, process, or business resource until
\`thread release\` reports owned-job quiescence \`confirmed\`. \`unknown\` and
\`unsupported\` stay fail-closed, and \`reason\` carries why a release could not
be confirmed. \`resourcesReleased=true\` only reports scoped
native resource suspension, not owned-job quiescence; it does not authorize
worktree or business-resource cleanup. Lifecycle-capable Harnesses can suspend
after 60 idle seconds and resume for the next action or full history read.
Use compact status/wait-many for observation without waking suspended Sessions.
\`always-approve\` is the Grok unattended
permission mode; it is not an OS read-only sandbox. Independent review requires
a new task plus prompt/readback, not a sandbox flag.

Inspect the target Harness before selecting Model or Thinking. Preserve the
caller-specified Harness and Model; never silently switch to Codex. Recover a
creating or unreadable child with \`delegate reconcile\` (dry-run first).
